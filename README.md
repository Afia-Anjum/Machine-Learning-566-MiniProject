Classification Techniques on Cervical Cancer Data

Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological cancer around the world. In our approach, we look into finding the best screening strategy for a cervical cancer patient by applying three different machine learning algorithms namely logistic regression, support vector machine and neural network. These classification techniques work on thirty-two different features from eight hundred and fifty-eight samples which initiate the risk factor of cervical cancer. Two significant impediments of this data are missing value and imbalance data. Therefore, in our experiment, we use mutual imputation to handle missing value as well as over-sampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) approach to balance the data. Our experiment shows that neural network is the best classifier with 85.35% accuracy on this dataset.
